# School_District_Analysis
The original project consisted of analyzing data from two datafiles containing school and student details and deliver the following:
* A high-level snapshot of the district's key metrics, presented in a table format
* An overview of the key metrics for each school, presented in a table format
* Tables presenting each of the following metrics:
    1. Top 5 and bottom 5 performing schools, based on the overall passing rate
    2. The average math score received by students in each grade level at each school
    3. The average reading score received by students in each grade level at each school
    4. School performance based on the budget per student
    5. School performance based on the school size 
    6. School performance based on the type of school

After completing the analysis, the reliability of ninth grade reading and math scores of students from Thomas High School came under question. To ensure credibility the entire analysis was repeated after discarding the questionable data for ninth grade student grades for Thomas High School. The following report a comparison between the calculated metrics with original dataset and modified data without the questionable.
